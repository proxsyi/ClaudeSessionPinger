# Changelog

## v1.16.0

- Added on-by-default scheduled wake support for sleeping, plugged-in Macs, backed by a one-time administrator-installed helper that schedules persistent IOKit wake events.
- Wakes five seconds before each scheduled ping, holds a 120-second `PreventSystemSleep` assertion, and returns to sleep after a 30-second physical HID activity observation when the Mac remains unused.
- Added an in-app two-minute closed-lid wake/ping/return-to-sleep test, installation verification, schedule status, and a toggle that cancels app-owned wake events when disabled.
- Made the clear Liquid Glass setting update the Settings window live, including its background, cards, fields, rail, idle toggles, and usage tracks.
- Hold a short PreventSystemSleep assertion during scheduled clamshell wakes, schedule wake events five seconds before the ping, and record wake diagnostics so the app can finish work beyond macOS's native ten-second wake window.
- Enforce a five-hour minimum between every scheduled session, including the overnight boundary, and protect the five hours before the next scheduled start from availability-triggered starts.
- Prevent the clear-glass switch from animating every window surface in one transaction, and recognize Fable 5 usage across renamed and nested Claude usage-response formats.
- Fixed regular-glass Settings tab lockups by keeping one stable page hierarchy and non-interactive glass rails; non-clear mode now uses a denser clear-glass tint over the regular window material.
- Hardened scheduling, wake matching, overlapping ping handling, keychain updates, cookie validation, version parsing, model discovery, reset timestamps, countdown visibility, and connection-test input handling after a broader bug audit.
- Treat any non-empty Claude reply as a successful ping and fixed the wake-sync error path for Swift 5 compilation.
- Read Fable from dynamic model-scoped usage payloads, accurately mirror Weekly when Claude merges the Fable allowance into the shared pool, and remove expensive tab-wide glass animations for immediate Settings navigation.
- Added a lightweight sliding tab indicator and hardened closed-lid wake ownership so overdue timers cannot race the wake notification; extended the sleep assertion to cover ping retries.
- Registered for wake events on the NSWorkspace notification center so closed-lid wake handling actually runs.
- Persisted closed-lid test progress and pass/fail results and display the latest result whenever Settings opens.
- Corrected return-to-sleep activity detection to use IOHIDSystem hardware-input idle time and compare it with the actual 30-second observation window instead of requiring an impossible 60 seconds of idle time after wake.
- Made Start sessions when available evaluate immediately on Save and every usage refresh, protect the five hours before the next scheduled start, and suppress duplicate starts for five hours after any successful ping.

## v1.15.0

- Reorganized Settings into General, Usage, Alerts, and App tabs, moved the title beside the traffic lights, and shortened the window.
- Added Ping now to the next-session card and Command-U to toggle the menu bar popover.
- Command-U now uses a permission-free global hot key, toggles the popover from any app, and releases the shortcut when disabled.
- The full-width Liquid Glass settings rail supports clicking or dragging between tabs, with smoother page transitions.
- Fixed the next-possible countdown to follow Claude's actual session reset instead of the next scheduled ping, including after the final daily schedule slot.
- Added independent next-possible and scheduled countdown toggles plus a main-focus selector when both are visible.
- Command-U now debounces key repeat, Command-, saves before closing Settings and restores the popover, and Claude service status opens the public status site.
- Replaced flat switches, fields, segmented choices, threshold pills, schedule controls, progress tracks, and login actions with interactive Liquid Glass variants while retaining requested status and accent colors.
- Command-U now tracks the physical key-down/key-up cycle so holding the shortcut cannot toggle the popover twice.
- Restored the compact Ping and countdown-control layouts while keeping their existing fields, steppers, and segmented control on Liquid Glass surfaces; reduced switch sizing.
- Added a modifier-state recovery path and popover transition guard for more reliable Command-U behavior when macOS misses the Carbon release event.
- Removed redundant glass wrappers from native model, schedule, and countdown selectors so macOS renders each control once; restored the original compact schedule button treatment.
- Changed the countdown main-focus control to the same compact menu selector used by the model picker.
- Added configurable notifications for newly available and app-started sessions, plus an off-by-default option to start newly available sessions outside the schedule.
- Switched custom surfaces to adaptive system Liquid Glass with a user-selectable clear appearance that follows macOS accessibility and appearance settings.

## v1.14.0

- Added an optional Fable 5 weekly usage bar with tolerant parsing for undocumented usage-payload key variants.
- Added Settings toggles for the session, weekly, and Fable 5 bars; session and weekly are visible by default.

## v1.13.0

- All scheduled, manual, and test pings now reuse one dedicated Claude chat instead of creating a new conversation every time.
- Added Settings actions to open the dedicated pinger chat or intentionally start fresh; a deleted chat is replaced automatically on the next ping.
- Updated notification authorization to the async macOS API, removing the Xcode 27 build warning.

## v1.12.0

- The menu bar icon now turns crimson at 100% session usage and shows a live countdown until the session resets.
- Moved success rate, the last ping result, errors, and the manual Ping now action from the popover into a new Settings Activity section.
- Replaced automatic model mode with a manual model picker. The selected model is always tried first, with detected and known models used as fallbacks if Claude rejects it.
- Added 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, and 100% notification threshold choices for session and weekly usage.
- Aligned schedule times into fixed time and AM/PM columns.
- The main countdown now follows the next usable session when the current window is maxed out, with the next scheduled ping shown underneath.
- Re-runs the stable-signing keychain ownership repair once so legacy credentials stop asking for a password on later launches.
- Changed the personal app identity to `com.proxsyi.claudesessionpinger` and migrates existing settings and credentials from the legacy identity.
- Build output now removes post-signing Finder metadata and must pass strict signature verification before it is considered complete.

## v1.11.0

- Fixed the keychain password prompt reappearing after every update: the stored session entries were created by older ad-hoc-signed builds, so macOS never treated new builds as their owner. On first launch the app now re-creates its keychain entries under the stable signing identity (one final prompt during this migration, then never again).
- Settings window glass now extends under the title bar, removing the transparent strip and the doubled "Settings" title.
- Settings header clears the traffic-light buttons, and the scroll bar no longer draws on top of the content.

## v1.10.0

- Fixed usage notifications re-alerting limits that were already hit: the first fetch after launch now records existing usage silently, and server-side jitter in window reset timestamps no longer wipes the "already notified" memory (this was the source of the random repeat alerts).
- Ping-failure notifications now use a stable identifier so repeats replace the previous alert instead of stacking duplicates.
- The test notification button now requests notification permission on the spot when it was never granted, and reports delivery errors instead of failing silently.
- Clear Liquid Glass: panels now use the clear glass variant instead of frosted, and the Settings window background is far more transparent.
- Fixed Settings content clipping through the header and footer while scrolling.
- New 16x16 app icon following the house icon design rules (rounded panel, greyish-teal border with top highlight, Claude-orange face, outlined stopwatch symbol).
- README rewritten: simple explanation of what the app does, clean install steps, and how to get past Gatekeeper's "cannot verify" block on first launch.
- Release flow now removes the build copy of the app after publishing so Spotlight no longer shows duplicate Session Pingers.

## v1.9.0

- Complete visual refresh: the pixel/retro look is gone. The whole app -- popover, Settings, progress bars, and the menu bar icon -- is now clean, minimal Liquid Glass driven by the system's materials.
- Claude service alerts now distinguish full outages from degraded performance, using the severity reported by Claude's status page, and still announce recovery.
- Every notification type has its own toggle in Settings: ping failures, Claude services down, Claude performing poorly, and the individual usage thresholds.
- The menu bar icon is now a clean sparkle tinted by session usage instead of the pixel starburst; usage bars are smooth capsules instead of segmented blocks.
- Settings restyled with right-aligned switches, quieter typography, and capsule threshold pills.

## v1.8.0

- Settings reorganized: the organization ID and manual session key now live in a collapsed "Keys" area under Account -- they're captured automatically at login, so they stay out of the way.
- Logging in now captures every claude.ai cookie (not just the session key) and stores them in the keychain; all requests -- pings, usage, model detection, org lookup -- send the full cookie set, exactly like the browser session.
- Automatic model selection: the app detects which Claude models the account can use, prefers the lightest one, and switches automatically if claude.ai rejects a model. A toggle in Settings switches back to a fixed manual model slug.
- Added a "Send test notification" button in Settings, with a hint when macOS has notifications turned off for the app.
- Auto-update is now a toggle: when on, new releases install themselves as soon as the daily check finds one (each version is attempted once, so a failed install can't loop).
- The Settings window is now real behind-window Liquid Glass driven by the system's material settings (including Reduce Transparency), with a transparent title bar.
- Fixed scrolled Settings content drawing over the Test connection/Cancel/Save footer buttons.

## v1.7.0

- Full pixel/retro restyle layered on the existing Liquid Glass panels, keeping the Claude color palette: monospaced pixel typography, uppercase tracked section headers, square status dots, and chunky segmented "health bar" usage meters. The menu bar star is now true 16x16 pixel art, still color-coded by session usage (green/yellow/red).
- Settings redesigned into glass sections -- Account, Ping, Notifications, App, Updates -- to match everything the app now does.
- Logging in now always captures everything the app needs: if the organization cookie is slow to appear, the organization ID is fetched straight from claude.ai with the new session, and usage refreshes immediately after signing in.
- New notifications: Claude service outage and recovery alerts (toggleable), plus customizable session and weekly usage alerts -- pick any of the 50/75/90/95% thresholds in Settings, each firing at most once per usage window.
- All notifications now play a sound.

## v1.6.0

- Added ClaudeUsageBar-style Claude usage tracking to the menu bar popover: session (5-hour) and weekly (7-day) usage bars with reset times, read from the same claude.ai endpoint that powers claude.ai/settings/usage using the session key the app already stores, plus a Claude service status line and a manual Refresh button. Usage auto-refreshes every 5 minutes and when the popover opens.
- The menu bar item is now a 16x16 color-coded starburst (green under 70%, yellow from 70%, red from 90% session usage; gray while unknown) with the current session percentage shown next to it, replacing the old status circle icons. Ping status remains visible via the colored dot in the popover header.

## v1.5.3

- Fixed the menu bar icon not opening its popover: the launch-time cleanup that hides the stray empty Settings window was too broad and also closed the status item's own window. It now closes only the leftover "<App Name> Settings" window and leaves the menu bar item and popover alone.

## v1.5.2

- The build script now signs the app with a stable code-signing identity when one is available (falling back to ad-hoc otherwise), so once a signing certificate exists the macOS keychain stops re-prompting for access after every update.

## v1.5.1

- Fixed a blank "Session Pinger Settings" window that could appear on launch: it was the leftover empty SwiftUI settings scene, which is now closed automatically so only the real Settings window ever shows.
- The Settings Updates section now shows the current app version and is separated by a divider.

## v1.5.0

- Added real auto-updating: the app now checks this repo's public GitHub Releases and can download, install, and relaunch itself into a new version with one click ("Install & Restart") -- no more manual rebuilds to pick up a new release, and no token or login needed.
- Added `Scripts/release.sh`, which builds the app, zips it, tags the current version, and publishes it as a GitHub release with that zip attached, so one script call ships an update.

## v1.4.2

- Removed manual `WKProcessPool` sharing in the login web view -- deprecated since macOS 12 and no longer had any effect, so it was just dead code producing build warnings.
- Settings now defaults the model slug to Claude Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) instead of leaving it blank, including for installs that had already saved an empty value.
- Fixed the Settings schedule rows so the time stepper and remove button line up in a column instead of shifting based on the time label's width.
- Fixed Settings buttons (including "Check for updates") sometimes rendering as an empty shape with no visible label, by wrapping the Settings view in a `GlassEffectContainer` like the menu bar popover already does.

## v1.4.1

- Settings now only toggles with Cmd+, -- removed the Ctrl+, variant of the shortcut to avoid clashing with other apps' own Ctrl+, bindings.

## v1.4.0

- Added a real app icon: a hand-styled pixel-art stopwatch on the house icon design (rounded panel, greyish-teal border, Claude-orange face), replacing the generic default icon in Finder and Launchpad.
- Pressing Cmd+, now opens Settings from the menu bar popover, and closes Settings again when it's already open -- no need to reach for the mouse.
- Added the groundwork for update checks: the app can now check a version feed once a day and show a "Version X is available" banner with a download link, both in the menu bar and in Settings. Real checking is off until a release feed is hosted somewhere -- see the note in `UpdateChecker.swift`.

## v1.3.0

- Schedule times now show as a normal 12-hour clock (e.g. "5:00 AM", "3:00 PM") instead of 24-hour notation.
- Moved "Test connection", "Cancel", and "Save" into a fixed bar at the bottom of Settings so they're always fully visible and clickable instead of potentially sitting below the fold in the scrolling area; the Settings window is also resizable now.
- The built-in Claude login screen loads noticeably faster on repeat opens by reusing a warmed-up web engine process instead of starting a fresh one every time, and no longer runs Web Inspector instrumentation in the shipped build.

## v1.2.2

- Fixed: logging in through the built-in browser sometimes finished before claude.ai had set its organization cookie, so the app came back with a session but no organization ID. Login now waits a few seconds for that cookie before finishing.
- If the organization ID still can't be detected automatically after logging in, Settings now shows a clear note explaining how to find and paste it manually.

## v1.2.1

- Fixed a release build failure on Xcode 27 / Swift 6 strict concurrency checking: `AppDelegate` wasn't isolated to the main actor, so its lazy `AppState` property (which is main-actor-isolated) failed to initialize. `AppDelegate` is now explicitly `@MainActor`.
- Fixed a related concurrency warning where the login screen's cookie-polling timer called a main-actor method from a non-isolated timer callback.
- Fixed: a scheduled ping that fails because credentials aren't configured yet no longer leaves the menu bar countdown stuck; it now reschedules and sends a failure notification like every other failure path.
- Fixed: an OAuth sign-in popup (e.g. "Continue with Google") could spuriously flip the main login screen into a loading/error state from its own unrelated navigation events; popup and main window navigation are now tracked separately.
- Fixed: closing an OAuth sign-in popup with its native close button (instead of the page closing itself) could leave it tracked internally after the window was gone; closing the login screen while a popup is still open now closes that popup too.
- Made the Settings window's "Cancel" and "Test connection" buttons visually consistent with the rest of the glass UI.

## v1.2.0

- Replaced `MenuBarExtra(.window)` with a proper `NSStatusItem` + `NSPopover` (transient behavior), so clicking outside the menu bar popover now dismisses it, matching standard macOS menu bar app behavior.
- Settings is now a real, independently managed `NSWindow` instead of a sheet, avoiding SwiftUI window-scene ambiguity.
- Fixed built-in Claude login: added a realistic desktop Safari user agent, popup-window support for "Continue with Google"-style SSO flows, loading/error states with a retry action, and an inspectable web view for debugging.
- Applied a translucent, layered "glass" visual style (materials, soft gradient borders, tinted glass buttons) across the popover and settings UI, in the Claude accent palette.
- Removed the unused legacy `MenuBarLabel` SwiftUI view in favor of AppKit-managed status item icons.

## v1.0.0

- Initial release.
- Menu bar app (no Dock icon) that pings claude.ai on a configurable daily schedule (default 5am, 10am, 3pm, 8pm).
- Countdown to the next scheduled session shown in the menu bar popover.
- Success/failure tracking with a persisted history and running success rate.
- Session key stored in the macOS Keychain, never in plain text.
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient network/server errors.
- Distinct handling for expired session keys, rate limiting, and server errors.
- Local notification on failed pings.
- Recovers correctly after sleep/wake and system time zone changes.
- Launch-at-login toggle.
- In-app settings screen with a test-connection action.
